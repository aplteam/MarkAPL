 GetAllLinkRefs←{
⍝ This combs through the html and finds all link references ([][]-syntax).
⍝ Ignores in-line code.
⍝ Returns a three-item-vector for each hit.
⍝ [1] The link text - that can by anything.
⍝ [2] The ref id. That's what we hope to find in ns.linkRefs later on.
⍝     This must be US ASCII letters and digits and nothing else, not even white space.
⍝ [3] The match - -everything between the opening [ and the closing ], including [].

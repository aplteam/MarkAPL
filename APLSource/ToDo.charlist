## Technical debt: Toc!

The vars is initialised **not** with all its columns right from the start. Instead stuff is appended later on. Bad idea!

By appending new stuff I confused myself and later indexed the wrong column.

Next time we do this:

1. Initialize the variable with the correct number of columns
2. Create a namespace TocIndex which we use to keep index variables for indexing the Toc.

That makes the code far more readable **and** avoids bugs like the aforementioned one.

⍝ Test whether something is recognized as a code block that is fenced by ~~~ and ``` - it should not!
⍝ More precisely, the next corresponding fence should be taken into account, or the end of the document.
⍝ That is okay as long as the number of spaces is in line with the nesting, plus possibly up to three more spaces.
